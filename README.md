The project aims to develop a sentiment analysis model to predict the movement of stock prices based on textual data from news articles, social media posts, and other sources of financial news and opinions. By analyzing the sentiment expressed in these texts, the model will seek to uncover insights into investor sentiment and market sentiment, which can be valuable indicators for making informed trading decisions.
Objectives:
Collect a large dataset of textual data related to stocks, including news articles, social media posts, earnings reports, and analyst reports, from various sources.
Preprocess the textual data by removing noise, tokenizing text into words or phrases, and applying techniques such as stemming and lemmatization to standardize text representations.
Label the textual data with corresponding stock price movements (e.g., increase, decrease, or no change) over a specified time horizon to create a labeled dataset for supervised learning.
Extract features from the textual data, such as word frequencies, sentiment scores, and topic modeling representations, to represent the text in a format suitable for machine learning algorithms.
Train and evaluate machine learning models, including classification algorithms such as logistic regression, support vector machines (SVM), random forests, and neural networks, to predict stock price movements based on textual sentiment.
Perform model evaluation using appropriate metrics, such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis, to assess the performance of the sentiment analysis model.
